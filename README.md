## Overview

`Web-Security-Module` is designed to provide a single place to run common reconnaissance and lightweight security checks against web targets in a modular, repeatable manner. It is intended for **authorized** security testing, learning, and quick pre-engagement assessments. Use responsibly.

## Features

- **Web Information Gathering** — host, DNS, WHOIS, subdomain discovery, HTTP headers, robots.txt, sitemap parsing.  
- **Network Scanning** — ICMP/ARP discovery and network range scanning.  
- **Firewall Scan** — detect common firewall/IPS behavior and blocklist responses.  
- **SSL/TLS Scan** — certificate chain, expiration, weak ciphers, protocol versions (TLS 1.0/1.1 checks).  
- **Port Scan** — TCP & UDP port discovery with service detection.  
- **Cryptographic Failure Check** — checks for weak crypto (RC4, NULL ciphers), broken key sizes, insecure hashing.  
- **Mirror Site / Content Discovery** — brute-force content discovery, find mirrored content and backup files.  
- **Code Analysis** — static checks for common insecure patterns in client-side code (JS), simple secret leaks, and comments.  
- **DDoS Simulation (Educational)** — controlled, low-rate request bursts to test resilience (ONLY in a permitted, lab environment).  
- **Cookie / Session Grab Helpers** — automated checks for insecure cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite), session fixation vectors.  
- **Consolidated Report Generation** — output as JSON and HTML with sections, severity ratings, evidence, and remediation notes.

## Requirements

Minimum environment (recommended):

- Windows (WSL recommended)  
- .Net version 8 or +

> Tip: For reproducible runs, use a Docker container or a Python virtualenv.
